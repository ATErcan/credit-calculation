# Bank Loan Calculator

A simple website to calculate bank loan. User chooses the loan type, the expiry date and the amount of the loan. And website returns a table with information about the loan.

I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the layout. 
I used vanilla Js for Javascript codes; no innerHTML used.
I also used Js DOM.
